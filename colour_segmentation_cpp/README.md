### Overview

This is simply a c++ implementation of ```../cameramouse/hand_tracking/```. It was created to make the OpenCV code integrable with mediapipe. The resulting mediapipe code can be found in ```../mediapipe/mediapipe/calculators/util/hand_tracking_calculator.cc```. To view the mediapipe graph to understand how this works go https://viz.mediapipe.dev/ and paste the contents of ```../mediapipe/mediapipe/graphs/hand_tracking/gesture_recognition.pbtxt``` into it.
